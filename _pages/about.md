<p style="text-align: justify; font-size: 15px;">This is <strong>Md. Mahbubul Kabir Nishat</strong>. I am working at <strong>PricewaterhouseCoopers (PwC)</strong>—the world's second-largest professional services network and one of the Big Four accounting firms. I am based in Bangladesh, where I lead the implementation of <strong>Supply Chain and Manufacturing modules</strong>, collaborating with cross-functional teams to deliver digital transformation solutions across the pharmaceutical, textile, electronics, and chemical manufacturing sectors.
</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; font-size: 15px;">Before joining PwC, I completed my <strong>M.Sc. in Industrial & Production Engineering (IPE) from Bangladesh University of Engineering and Technology (BUET)</strong>, where I served as a <strong>Teaching Assistant</strong>. I obtained my <strong>B.Sc. in IPE at Khulna University of Engineering and Technology (KUET)</strong>, where I was honored with the <strong>Dean's Award and University Merit Scholarship</strong> in recognition of my outstanding academic performance. I have also served as a <strong>Guest Lecturer at the National Institute of Textile Engineering and Research (NITER)</strong>.
</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; font-size: 15px;">My current research interests center on <strong>smart and connected systems, Industrial Artificial Intelligence, and data-driven manufacturing process control</strong>. My previous research includes Cyber-Physical Systems, IoT-enabled automation, machine learning for epidemiological modeling (supported by Bangladesh's Ministry of Science and Technology), Digital Twin-based process control, and reinforcement learning for manufacturing and healthcare optimization. I conceptualize and develop methods to solve complex problems by either hybridizing different techniques or by adopting ideas from seemingly unrelated fields to create novel, interdisciplinary solutions.
